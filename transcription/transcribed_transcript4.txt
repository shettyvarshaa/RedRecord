 Ever heard of Pavlov? No, that's a Pavlov. Pavlov was a physiologist, nor a delicious cake. Ivan Pavlov was interested in reactions. He rang a bell, fed a dog, and took note of what it did. Then he rang a bell, didn't feed the dog, and took note of what it did. That might not sound like much, but what he discovered was really, really important. This is called classical conditioning, and it's part of the psychology of learning. Though Murray, there's a lot more to it than bells ringing and dogs getting hungry. What it shows us is that we can learn in different ways. Sometimes we're learning when we don't realise it. In fact, we learn all the time, like right now. In this course, we're going to have a look at the psychology of learning, different learning theories and the benefits of understanding the psychology of learning.
